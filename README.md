## :computer:Task Manager Web App with Redis Database using Python Flask Framework

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is a micro WSGIi(Web Server Gateway Interface) framework written in Python.

[Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/0.15.x/), [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/) for UI, form rendering and validations ;)

>I have programmed this project to work on Windows

The Redis project does not officially support Windows. However, the Microsoft Open Tech group develops and maintains this Windows port targeting Win64. You can find the releases here at [GitHub microsoftarchive/redis](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/).

use ```pip install``` or ``` pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the dependencies.

start the redis server
run the python file and visit localhost:5000 :bowtie:

Suggestion: can use redis insight(bugs) or VS Code redis extention to cross check redis database.
